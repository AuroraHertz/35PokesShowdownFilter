# 35 Pokes Showdown Filter
This is a Chrome Extension that will filter Pokemon Showdown so only the relevant pokemon of the month are visible

## Developers
This project was brought to me by discord user hannahfantasia. They had the idea for a userscript that would filter Pokemon Showdown, as well as the starter javascript code to filter the Pokemon based on specific element attributes.
